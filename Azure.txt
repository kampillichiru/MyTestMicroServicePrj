Perfect üëç ‚Äî here‚Äôs a **clean, reusable, production-ready GitHub Actions setup** for your **Release Orchestrator** that triggers multiple microservices, passes dynamic inputs (branch, version, environment), and captures their outputs cleanly.

---

## üß© Structure Overview

You‚Äôll have:

```
release-orchestrator/
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ .github/
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ workflows/
        ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ orchestrate-releases.yml
service-a/
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ .github/
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ workflows/
        ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ release.yml
service-b/
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ .github/
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ workflows/
        ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ release.yml
...
```

## üöÄ `release-orchestrator/.github/workflows/orchestrate-releases.yml`

This is the **main orchestrator** that loops over services and dispatches release events.

```yaml
name: Orchestrate Microservice Releases

on:
  workflow_dispatch:
    inputs:
      release_version:
        description: "Version to release (e.g., 1.2.3)"
        required: true
      release_branch:
        description: "Branch to release from (e.g., main)"
        required: true
        default: "main"
      environment:
        description: "Target environment (dev, uat, prod)"
        required: true
        default: "uat"

jobs:
  orchestrate:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    env:
      ORG: your-org-name
      SERVICES: "service-a service-b service-c"
      GH_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.PAT_TOKEN }}

    steps:
      - name: Log Inputs
        run: |
          echo "üîπ Release version: ${{ github.event.inputs.release_version }}"
          echo "üîπ Branch: ${{ github.event.inputs.release_branch }}"
          echo "üîπ Environment: ${{ github.event.inputs.environment }}"

      - name: Trigger Releases for Each Service
        id: trigger
        run: |
          release_version="${{ github.event.inputs.release_version }}"
          release_branch="${{ github.event.inputs.release_branch }}"
          environment="${{ github.event.inputs.environment }}"
          results_file="release-results.txt"
          echo "" > "$results_file"

          for service in $SERVICES; do
            echo "üöÄ Triggering release for $service ..."
            
            response=$(curl -s -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code}" \
              -X POST \
              -H "Authorization: Bearer $GH_TOKEN" \
              -H "Accept: application/vnd.github+json" \
              https://api.github.com/repos/$ORG/$service/dispatches \
              -d "{\"event_type\": \"trigger-release\", \"client_payload\": {
                \"release_version\": \"$release_version\",
                \"release_branch\": \"$release_branch\",
                \"environment\": \"$environment\"
              }}")

            if [ "$response" = "204" ]; then
              echo "‚úÖ $service: Triggered successfully" | tee -a "$results_file"
            else
              echo "‚ùå $service: Failed (HTTP $response)" | tee -a "$results_file"
            fi
          done

          echo "---- Summary ----"
          cat "$results_file"

      - name: Upload Release Summary
        uses: actions/upload-artifact@v4
        with:
          name: release-summary
          path: release-results.txt
```

### ‚úÖ Clean Code Highlights

* Uses environment variables for org and token.
* Loops cleanly through a list of services.
* Produces a summary file (`release-results.txt`).
* Uploads results as an artifact for reference.
* Easy to extend ‚Äî just add more services to `SERVICES`.

## üß© `service-a/.github/workflows/release.yml`

This is the **receiver workflow** in each microservice.

```yaml
name: Microservice Release

on:
  repository_dispatch:
    types: [trigger-release]

jobs:
  release:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - name: Print received parameters
        run: |
          echo "üîπ Release Version: ${{ github.event.client_payload.release_version }}"
          echo "üîπ Release Branch:  ${{ github.event.client_payload.release_branch }}"
          echo "üîπ Environment:     ${{ github.event.client_payload.environment }}"

      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v4
        with:
          ref: ${{ github.event.client_payload.release_branch }}

      - name: Build and Release
        run: |
          echo "üöÄ Running Maven release for version ${{ github.event.client_payload.release_version }}"
          mvn -B clean deploy -Drevision=${{ github.event.client_payload.release_version }}

      - name: Create Git Tag
        run: |
          git config user.name "github-actions"
          git config user.email "actions@github.com"
          git tag "v${{ github.event.client_payload.release_version }}"
          git push origin "v${{ github.event.client_payload.release_version }}"

      - name: Notify Success
        run: |
          echo "‚úÖ Release completed for ${{ github.repository }}: version ${{ github.event.client_payload.release_version }}"
```

## üß© Optional ‚Äî Output Collection (Future Enhancement)

If you want to **collect each microservice‚Äôs release version** automatically and update a file like `argocd/values.yaml`, you can later:

1. Store the version info in an artifact (each microservice).
2. The orchestrator can call the GitHub API to fetch those artifacts.
3. Update the ArgoCD values file programmatically.

That‚Äôs a natural next step once triggering is working.

---

## üß© Clean Reusability Enhancements

You can make this even cleaner by:

* Moving the service list into a file:
  `.github/services.txt`
* Adding retry logic for transient network issues.
* Using reusable workflows for each release logic (if you need consistent release processes).

## ‚úÖ Summary

| File                       | Purpose                                               |
| -------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| `orchestrate-releases.yml` | Central workflow to trigger all microservice releases |
| `release.yml`              | Handles the release in each service                   |
| `release-results.txt`      | Collects status of all triggered releases             |
| `PAT_TOKEN`                | GitHub token with `repo` + `workflow` scopes          |

Would you like me to extend this setup to include **updating `argocd/values.yaml` automatically** once all releases complete?
That‚Äôs the next step after successful orchestration.
