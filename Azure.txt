Here is a breakdown of key **sections** with bullet points for each component of your **solution proposal** for migrating a microservices-based banking application from on-prem to Azure, using Terraform, GitHub Actions, Helm, and Argo CD.

---

## 🧭 **1. Executive Summary**

* Modernize infrastructure by migrating from on-prem Kubernetes to Azure AKS.
* Improve security, scalability, and DevOps efficiency using cloud-native services.
* Adopt GitOps (Argo CD) and Infrastructure as Code (Terraform) for full lifecycle automation.

---

## 🏗️ **2. Current State (On-Premises Architecture)**

* Kubernetes (self-managed) hosting backend microservices (Spring Boot) and Angular frontend.
* CI/CD using GitHub Actions with deployment via Helm.
* Docker registry: Harbor (on-prem).
* Secrets managed locally.
* PostgreSQL and Elasticsearch hosted on-prem.

---

## 🚀 **3. Target State (Azure Cloud Architecture)**

* **Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)** for container orchestration.
* **Azure Container Registry (ACR)** for Docker image storage.
* **Azure Key Vault** for secrets and credentials management.
* **Azure PostgreSQL Flexible Server** for managed database hosting.
* **Azure Cognitive Search** (optional) or **self-managed Elasticsearch** on AKS.
* CI/CD via **GitHub Actions** → **Argo CD** with **Helm** charts.
* **Azure DevOps Repos** (or GitHub) as Git source.

---

## 🧱 **4. Terraform Setup (Infrastructure as Code)**

* Modular Terraform design for:

  * `networking` (VNet, subnets, NSG)
  * `aks-cluster` (AKS with autoscaling, node pools)
  * `acr` (Azure Container Registry)
  * `key-vault` (for secrets/keys)
  * `postgresql` (Azure-managed PostgreSQL)
* Benefits:

  * Reproducibility, auditability, and ease of environment replication.
  * Incremental, environment-specific deployment support (dev/staging/prod).

---

## 🐙 **5. CI/CD Pipeline (GitHub Actions)**

* CI:

  * Checkout, test, and build the Spring Boot backend and Angular frontend.
  * Docker build and push to ACR.
* CD:

  * Sync with Argo CD to auto-deploy updated Helm charts to AKS.
* Secrets securely pulled from GitHub Secrets and Azure Key Vault.
* Branch-based deployment strategy (`main` → prod, `dev` → dev env).

---

## 🎯 **6. GitOps with Argo CD**

* Continuous deployment managed via GitOps approach.
* Helm-based manifests stored in Git repository.
* Argo CD continuously reconciles AKS state with the desired state in Git.
* Self-healing, rollback, and audit trails.
* Environment-specific `Application.yaml` per service.

---

## ⛵ **7. Helm Charts (Reusable Deployments)**

* Templated Kubernetes manifests for:

  * Deployment
  * Service
  * Ingress
* Parameterized via `values.yaml`.
* Charts stored in Git and used by both developers and Argo CD.
* Enables multi-environment and multi-service deployments using consistent templates.

---

## 🔐 **8. Security**

* All secrets (DB, tokens) stored in **Azure Key Vault**.
* Access controlled via **managed identity** (MSI) and RBAC.
* Secure image storage and scanning in ACR.
* Network security via private AKS cluster, NSG, and restricted subnet access.
* GitHub Actions uses OIDC to authenticate with Azure securely.

---

## 🗂️ **9. Repository Strategy**

* Monorepo or multi-repo options:

  * `/terraform` – infrastructure IaC modules
  * `/helm` – Helm charts for each microservice
  * `/argocd` – Argo CD Application manifests
  * `/src/backend-service` – Spring Boot app
  * `/src/frontend-app` – Angular app

## 📊 **10. Migration Plan (Phased Approach)**

| Phase   | Task                                       |
| ------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| Phase 1 | Set up Azure resources with Terraform      |
| Phase 2 | Containerize apps & push to ACR            |
| Phase 3 | Setup Helm charts for microservices        |
| Phase 4 | Configure Argo CD for GitOps               |
| Phase 5 | Setup GitHub Actions CI/CD                 |
| Phase 6 | Data migration (PostgreSQL, Elasticsearch) |
| Phase 7 | Final cutover and monitoring enablement    |

## 📈 **11. Benefits**

* 🔄 Full automation of infrastructure and deployment.
* 🛡️ Improved security via Azure-native tools.
* 🚀 Faster and more reliable deployments.
* 📉 Reduced on-prem maintenance burden.
* 📦 Clear separation of concern: CI (GitHub) vs. CD (Argo CD).
