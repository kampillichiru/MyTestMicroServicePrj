Here’s a structured approach for your PowerPoint presentation, covering the three required slides:

---

### **Slide 1: Business Focus Area & Research Approach**  
**Title:** *Enhancing Internal Stakeholder Engagement*  

**Key Points:**  
- **Business Challenge:** How can we create a more engaging and satisfying experience for internal stakeholders (peers & managers) while leveraging expertise?  
- **Research Approach:**  
  - **Ethnographic Study:** Interviews with senior managers, product owners, and young graduates.  
  - **Empathy Mapping:** Captured user thoughts, feelings, and pain points.  
  - **AEIOU Canvas Tool:** Used to analyze observations and insights.  

**Visual:** A simple flowchart showing the research process (Interviews → Empathy Mapping → AEIOU Canvas → Insights).

### **Slide 2: Tools & Key Insights**  
**Title:** *Discovery & Ideation*  

**Key Points:**  
- **Ideation Tools Used:**  
  - *Yes And* – 22 Ideas  
  - *Biomimicry* – 23 Ideas  
  - *Six Thinking Hats* – 29 Ideas  
  - *What-If* – 12 Ideas  
  - **Total Ideas Generated:** 86  

- **Final Pain Points Identified:**  
  - Lack of visibility for young graduates (YGs).  
  - Unclear career progression leading to attrition.  
  - Limited structured engagement with stakeholders.  

**Visual:** A mind map or icons representing the ideation tools + a pain points summary.

### **Slide 3: How Might We & Top 3 Ideas**  
**Title:** *How Might We Foster YG Engagement & Reduce Attrition?*  

**How Might We Statement:**  
*"How might we create a system for YGs (1-2 years experience) to engage with stakeholders, fostering future contributions and reducing attrition from X% to Y%?"*  

**Top 3 Shortlisted Ideas:**  
1. **YG Branding:** BU-level achievement and recognition boards to enhance visibility among senior managers.  
2. **Assured Incremental Compensation:** Fixed 20% increase for three years + performance-based variable pay.  
3. **Mentor/Mentee Program:** Confidential, tool-managed mentor assignments with customized recommendations.  

**Visual:** Icons or small graphics for each of the three ideas.


I can't create the PowerPoint directly, but I can guide you on how to design it with visuals and icons effectively. Here's how you can structure each slide visually:

---

### **Slide 1: Business Focus Area & Research Approach**  
📌 **Title:** *Enhancing Internal Stakeholder Engagement*  

🔹 **Visual Elements:**  
- Use a **flowchart** or **process diagram** to illustrate research steps:  
  **User Interviews → Empathy Mapping → AEIOU Canvas → Insights**  
- Add an **icon** for each research method:  
  - 🎤 Interview icon for ethnography  
  - 💡 Brain icon for empathy mapping  
  - 📊 Chart icon for AEIOU analysis  

📝 **Key Content:**  
- Business Challenge (Textbox with a question mark icon ❓)  
- Research Methods (Bullet points with matching icons)  
- **Background Color:** Light blue/grey for a professional look  

---

### **Slide 2: Tools & Key Insights**  
📌 **Title:** *Discovery & Ideation*  

🔹 **Visual Elements:**  
- **Mind Map or Infographic** to represent ideation tools:  
  - **Yes And (🤝 22 ideas)**  
  - **Biomimicry (🌿 23 ideas)**  
  - **Six Thinking Hats (🎩 29 ideas)**  
  - **What-If (❓ 12 ideas)**  
- **Pain Points in a Callout Box:**  
  - 🚫 Lack of visibility for YGs  
  - ⚠️ Unclear career progression  
  - 🏢 Limited structured engagement  

📝 **Key Content:**  
- Total Ideas Generated: **86** (Bold it for impact)  
- Clear connection between ideation and pain points  

🎨 **Design Tip:** Use contrasting colors (e.g., blue for tools, red for pain points)  

---

### **Slide 3: How Might We & Top 3 Ideas**  
📌 **Title:** *How Might We Foster YG Engagement & Reduce Attrition?*  

🔹 **Visual Elements:**  
- **Bold "How Might We" Question** in the center with an idea lightbulb icon 💡  
- **Three Idea Cards (Side-by-Side Layout):**  
  1. **YG Branding 🏆** – Recognition boards for visibility  
  2. **Incremental Compensation 💰** – Assured 20% hike over 3 years  
  3. **Mentor/Mentee Program 👥** – Personalized matching tool  

📝 **Key Content:**  
- Concise descriptions for each idea  
- Icons + color-coded backgrounds for differentiation  

🎨 **Design Tip:** Use **rounded rectangles** with a shadow effect to highlight the three ideas
