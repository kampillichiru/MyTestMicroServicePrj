Since your legacy Java-based web application uses **JSF and Hibernate-based entities** and is currently hosted on **WebSphere**, migrating to **WildFly** requires compatibility checks, particularly with **Hibernate** versions.

### Key Considerations:
1. **WebSphere Default Hibernate Version**:  
   - WebSphere traditionally bundled **older versions of Hibernate (e.g., 3.x or 4.x)**.
   - If your code was developed on **WebSphere's default Hibernate version**, ensure you match the same major version in WildFly.

2. **WildFly Default Hibernate Version**:  
   - WildFly includes **Hibernate ORM as a JPA provider**.
   - Depending on the WildFly version:
     - WildFly 10 → Hibernate 5.1  
     - WildFly 17+ → Hibernate 5.3+  
     - WildFly 26+ → Hibernate 5.5+  
   - **If your application was running on Hibernate 3.x/4.x in WebSphere, WildFly’s default Hibernate version (5.x+) might cause compatibility issues.**

### Recommended Approach:
- **Identify the Hibernate version used in WebSphere** (`pom.xml` or `lib` folder if using a JAR).
- **If WebSphere used Hibernate 3.x or 4.x, stick to Hibernate 4.x/5.x** in WildFly.
- **Explicitly bundle Hibernate JARs with your application** instead of using the built-in WildFly JPA provider.
  - Add `hibernate-core` dependency in `pom.xml` (if using Maven).
  - Configure `jboss-deployment-structure.xml` to exclude WildFly’s built-in Hibernate:
    ```xml
    <jboss-deployment-structure>
      <deployment>
        <exclusions>
          <module name="org.hibernate" />
        </exclusions>
      </deployment>
    </jboss-deployment-structure>
    ```

### Final Recommendation:
- **Try Hibernate 4.3.x or 5.1.x** if you want minimal changes.
- If using Hibernate 3.x, you **must** upgrade since it’s **deprecated**.
- Ensure compatibility by testing with **`hibernate-entitymanager`** and **`hibernate-core`**.
