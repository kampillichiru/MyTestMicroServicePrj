No Technology Upgrade Required – No need to migrate or upgrade existing technologies such as JSF, Hibernate, or CGI.
REST API Integration – A REST API can be developed and hosted on WildFly, enabling seamless communication with COBOL programs via the CICS Gateway.
Replacing Direct COBOL Calls – Existing COBOL program calls can be replaced with REST API calls for better maintainability and scalability.
Minimal Code Changes – The transition involves minimal modifications, primarily replacing direct CICS calls with REST API interactions.
