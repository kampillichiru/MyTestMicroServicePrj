Here's your **grammatically corrected and simplified proposal** for better readability and clarity:  

---

# **Proposal: Deploying MYA.jar in a Kubernetes Environment**  

## **Current Understanding**  
Our product will package `myTest.war` inside a Docker image and use **WildFly** for deployment within the container.  

---

## **Proposed Approaches**  

### **Proposal-1: Using Persistent Volume**  
1. **Create a Persistent Volume (PV)** in our Kubernetes namespace.  
2. **Set up a GitHub Actions workflow** to copy `MYA.jar` to the Persistent Volume.  
3. **Coordinate with the My Product team** to mount the Persistent Volume to the Pod when building the Docker image.  
4. **Ensure the mounting path is included in the classpath**, similar to how WebSphere Application Server (WAS) handles shared libraries.  
5. **Use Kubernetes volume mounting** as an alternative approach.  
6. **Minimal changes required** for both My Product and our team.  
7. When **MyApp triggers an event, it will invoke `MYA.jar` locally**.  
8. `MYA.jar` will **expose a REST API** for further processing.  

---

### **Proposal-2: Embedding MYA.jar in the Docker Image**  
1. **Add `MYA.jar` to the existing Docker image**.  
2. **Rebuild the Docker image** based on the My Product teamâ€™s image using GitHub Actions.  
3. **Push the updated Docker image to Harbor** (container registry).  
4. **Deploy the updated image from Harbor** using GitHub Actions.  

---

### **Proposal-3: Minimal Change Approach**  
1. **MYA.jar will only contain REST API call logic**.  
2. **No significant changes in request/response structure**.  
3. **Code modifications will be rare**.  
4. **Share `MYA.jar` with the My Product team**.  
5. **My Product team will add `MYA.jar` to the classpath and build the Docker image**.  
6. **No changes required from our team**.  
7. **Only minor configuration changes needed for the My Product team**.  

---

## **Conclusion**  
Each approach offers different levels of flexibility and effort:  
- **Proposal-1** ensures **dynamic updates** via Persistent Volume.  
- **Proposal-2** offers **tighter integration** by embedding the JAR in the Docker image.  
- **Proposal-3** is the **simplest** with minimal effort on our side.
