Perfect ‚úÖ ‚Äî you‚Äôre thinking like a DevOps architect now.
Let‚Äôs design this end-to-end so you can:

1. Select multiple microservices for release.
2. Call each service‚Äôs **reusable workflow** in **parallel**.
3. Wait for all to finish successfully.
4. Collect their **new release versions (e.g., 1.2.4 ‚Üí 1.2.5)**.
5. Write those into a central file like `release-06-oct-2025.yaml`.

## üß© Step-by-Step Design

### üèóÔ∏è Structure Overview

```
.github/workflows/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ orchestrator.yml        # Main controller workflow
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ service-build.yml       # Callable (reusable) workflow for each service
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ finalize-release.yml    # Optional: for release tagging/promotion
```

---

## 1Ô∏è‚É£ The Callable Workflow ‚Äî `service-build.yml`

This workflow is reusable and runs for each service.

```yaml
name: Build and Tag Service

on:
  workflow_call:
    inputs:
      service_name:
        required: true
        type: string
      current_version:
        required: true
        type: string
    outputs:
      new_version:
        description: "Newly generated release version"
        value: ${{ jobs.build.outputs.new_version }}

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    outputs:
      new_version: ${{ steps.version.outputs.new_version }}

    steps:
      - name: Checkout repo
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Calculate next version
        id: version
        run: |
          CUR=${{ inputs.current_version }}
          IFS='.' read -r MAJ MIN PATCH <<< "$CUR"
          NEW="$MAJ.$MIN.$((PATCH+1))"
          echo "new_version=$NEW" >> $GITHUB_OUTPUT

      - name: Build & Push Docker Image
        run: |
          echo "Building Docker image for ${{ inputs.service_name }}:${{ steps.version.outputs.new_version }}"
          # docker build and push logic goes here

      - name: Output new version
        run: echo "Service ${{ inputs.service_name }} released as version ${{ steps.version.outputs.new_version }}"
```

---

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ The Orchestrator Workflow ‚Äî `orchestrator.yml`

This is the main controller that triggers parallel builds and collects versions.

```yaml
name: Enterprise Release Orchestrator

on:
  workflow_dispatch:
    inputs:
      release_id:
        description: "Release identifier (e.g., 06-oct-2025)"
        required: true
        type: string
      services:
        description: "Comma-separated service names"
        required: true
        type: string

jobs:
  prepare:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    outputs:
      matrix: ${{ steps.set-matrix.outputs.matrix }}
    steps:
      - id: set-matrix
        run: |
          services="${{ github.event.inputs.services }}"
          arr="["
          IFS=',' read -ra svc <<< "$services"
          for s in "${svc[@]}"; do
            arr="$arr\"${s// /}\","
          done
          arr="${arr%,}]"
          echo "matrix=$arr" >> $GITHUB_OUTPUT

  build:
    needs: prepare
    strategy:
      matrix:
        service: ${{ fromJson(needs.prepare.outputs.matrix) }}
      fail-fast: false
    uses: ./.github/workflows/service-build.yml
    with:
      service_name: ${{ matrix.service }}
      current_version: "1.0.0" # could come from a file or API

  finalize:
    needs: build
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout orchestrator repo
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Generate release manifest
        run: |
          echo "release_id: ${{ github.event.inputs.release_id }}" > release-${{ github.event.inputs.release_id }}.yaml
          echo "services:" >> release-${{ github.event.inputs.release_id }}.yaml
          for service in ${{ github.event.inputs.services }}; do
            echo "  - name: $service" >> release-${{ github.event.inputs.release_id }}.yaml
            echo "    version: <to-be-retrieved>" >> release-${{ github.event.inputs.release_id }}.yaml
          done

      - name: Commit and push release manifest
        run: |
          git config user.email "actions@github.com"
          git config user.name "GitHub Actions"
          git add release-${{ github.event.inputs.release_id }}.yaml
          git commit -m "Generated release manifest for ${{ github.event.inputs.release_id }}"
          git push
```

---

## 3Ô∏è‚É£ (Optional) Collect Versions from Sub-Workflows

To dynamically record actual versions from all child jobs, you can:

* Use `job.outputs` in reusable workflows.
* Write them to a temporary file and upload/download via `artifacts`.

Example (in finalize job):

```yaml
      - name: Collect new versions
        run: |
          echo "services:" > release-${{ github.event.inputs.release_id }}.yaml
          for service in ${{ github.event.inputs.services }}; do
            version=$(jq -r ".${service}" versions.json)
            echo "  - name: $service" >> release-${{ github.event.inputs.release_id }}.yaml
            echo "    version: $version" >> release-${{ github.event.inputs.release_id }}.yaml
          done
```

---

## üß† How It Works

1. You trigger `orchestrator.yml` manually and select services.
2. It dynamically builds a matrix and launches each service build in parallel.
3. Each child workflow (`service-build.yml`) builds, pushes image, and outputs a new version.
4. The orchestrator waits for all to finish.
5. Once done, it creates a file like:

   ```
   release-06-oct-2025.yaml
   ```

   containing all service names and their release versions.
6. This file is committed back to your orchestrator repo ‚Äî serving as a release record.

---

## ‚úÖ Benefits

* Fully automated release creation.
* Parallel service releases (fast).
* Audit-friendly release manifest per date.
* Easy to extend for **UAT ‚Üí PROD promotion**.
* Compatible with **ArgoCD sync**.

---

Would you like me to extend this so that the final step also **updates the ArgoCD manifests (values.yaml)** automatically using the generated release file? That‚Äôs usually the next logical step after `release-06-oct-2025.yaml` creation.
